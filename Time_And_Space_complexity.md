# Time Complexity 

</div>

## Time complexity :
-how fast or slow a program runs when the input size increases.
-It does not mean actual time (seconds/minutes)
-It means how the number of steps grows

## Simple example:

If an array has 5 elements, loop runs 5 times
If array has 100 elements, loop runs 100 times
So more data → more time.

Common cases:
-O(1) → very fast, runs in constant time
-O(n) → time increases with input size
-O(n²) → slow for large input (nested loops)

# Space Complexity 

</div>

Space complexity :
-how much extra memory a program uses.
-Only counts extra space, not input data
-Focuses on variables and extra arrays

## Simple example:
-Using only a few variables → O(1) space
-Creating an extra array of size n → O(n) space


## In Simple Words: 
Time complexity shows how execution time grows with input size, and space complexity shows how extra memory usage grows with input size.
