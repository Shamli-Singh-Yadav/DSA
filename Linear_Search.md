</div>

## What is linear search?
Linear Search is a searching technique in which elements of a list or array are checked one by one, sequentially, from the beginning until the desired element is found or the list ends.

# Time Complexity:
|Case	|Condition	       | Time|
|-------|------------------|-----|
|Best	| First element	   | O(1)|
|Average| Middle/random    | O(n)|
|Worst	| Last / Not found | O(n)|
